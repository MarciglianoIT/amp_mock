# ampersand_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

To test the application Flutter needs to be installed according the get started Tutorial: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab
After installing Flutter the application will work on web, android and ios with the command "flutter run"

The following 3 Barcodes are usable to test the Mock:
Barcode to test the first Scan of registering a Driver:

Barcode to verify the current Battery of a driver with the battery the driver brought to the station to prevent fraud:

Barcode to register a new battery:

Please note that the application is just a Mock without any backend verification etc. All data is currently saved in the barcode which technically makes no sense as it would cause to reprint a new barcode for every swap.

Thanks for reviewing.
